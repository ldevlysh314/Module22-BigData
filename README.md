# Module22-BigData

In this challenge, I used acquired knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

Please use google colab to tun the code.
